# UI Providers Module

## Purpose
The UI providers module contains React context providers that manage global UI state, theming, and cross-component communication. These providers enable consistent behavior and state management across the entire application.

## Architecture
Providers are organized by responsibility:
- **Theme Provider**: Manages application theming and styling
- **Component Provider**: Provides global component configuration
- **Layout Provider**: Manages responsive layouts and breakpoints
- **Accessibility Provider**: Handles accessibility settings and features
- **Plugin Provider**: Manages plugin UI integration and state

## Key Providers

### ComponentProvider
- **Purpose**: Provides global component configuration and defaults
- **Features**: Component registration, prop defaults, validation settings
- **Usage**: Wrap application root to enable component configuration

### ThemeProvider
- **Purpose**: Manages application theming and visual consistency
- **Features**: Color schemes, typography, spacing, dark mode support
- **Usage**: Enables theme switching and consistent styling

### AccessibilityProvider
- **Purpose**: Manages accessibility features and user preferences
- **Features**: High contrast, reduced motion, screen reader support
- **Usage**: Enables accessibility features throughout the application

### LayoutProvider
- **Purpose**: Manages responsive layouts and breakpoints
- **Features**: Viewport detection, orientation handling, responsive utilities
- **Usage**: Provides responsive behavior and layout information

## Usage
```typescript
import { 
  ComponentProvider, 
  ThemeProvider, 
  AccessibilityProvider 
} from '@/ui/providers';

// Wrap application with providers for global functionality
<ComponentProvider>
  <ThemeProvider>
    <AccessibilityProvider>
      <App />
    </AccessibilityProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
</ComponentProvider>
```

## Provider Context
Each provider exposes a context that can be consumed by components:
- **useComponent**: Access component configuration and utilities
- **useTheme**: Access theme values and switching functions
- **useAccessibility**: Access accessibility settings and helpers
- **useLayout**: Access layout state and responsive utilities

## Configuration
Provider behavior and defaults are configured in `config.ts`.

## Testing
- Unit tests for provider state management
- Integration tests for provider interactions
- Mock providers for component testing
- Accessibility tests for provider features
